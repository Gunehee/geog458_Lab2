# Narrative

* For these Word Clouds, I decided to observe the word "Food" as a topic. I chose this topic because "food" is one of the best interests of everyone and one of the most popular conversation topics. In order to create three Word Clouds with the theme of food, we selected three different areas in Washington State. First, I selected Bellevue, Tacoma, and Lynwood for a wide range observation. I set Bellevue with 12.6 miles, Tacoma with 8.5 miles, and Lynwood with 4.5 miles in the parameter range so that the areas did not overlap.
